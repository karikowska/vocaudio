My personal PC broke down and with it, the original repo & dataset I made myself, so this README is currently on the TODO list for when I fix it!

You can test out the app yourself here: https://vocaloid-classifier.streamlit.app/

And here's a demo gif:

You need to upload a music file from your local storage in order to classify. I plan to add automatic downloads later from online links, for ease of use.

I also plan to write a blog post on my experimental process, as I went through two pre-trained deep learners before I settled on an XGBoost as it did the job much better...sometimes simplicity is really all one needs!

Update 2/7/2025: my PC was unfortunately not repaired (as it was more worthwhile to throw away...), not all of it was recovered either so my self-made dataset is gone.....it will take a while to reproduce this so the blog will have to wait!
